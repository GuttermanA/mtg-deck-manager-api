# Spellbook Rails API: A Card, Deck, and Collection API for Magic the Gathering

This is a Rails API built for the [Spellbook](https://github.com/GuttermanA/spellbook) web application created as a final project at the Flatiron School. The API contains a PostgreSQL database seeded with the nearly 20,000 Magic: the Gathering Cards which is fully searchable on name and card type. Users can:

* Login with authentication
* View their saved decks and card collection
* View other user's decks
* Perform full CRUD action on their decks and collection
* Search a database of nearly 20,000 Magic cards
* Search for user decks

While this Rails app is built for my frontend, it has a fully functioning card database that you do not need authentication to use.

All deck and collection features require an account with a valid JWT token to use.

The information presented in this API about Magic: The Gathering, both literal and graphical, is copyrighted by Wizards of the Coast. This API is not produced, endorsed, supported, or affiliated with Wizards of the Coast.
